## Typefaces

The main typeface for the cards in this directory is [Goudy Bookletter 1911][goudy] by Barry Schwartz. It is similar in style to the ITC Garamond used by O'Reilly and associates for the Perl books. The typeface for "We suck at marketing" is [League Gothic][gothic] which was chosen for it's strong look and balance against the serifs of the main body text. Both of these fonts are available under the [Open Font License][license].

## Graphics

The Onion is the The Perl Foundation's trademark for Perl. This version was based on a version done by Mark Prather for the YAPC::NA 2011 branding. The backing graphics are the [Perl Monger Map][map], the [CPAN Testers Uploads graph][graph], and [Audrey Tang's revision of Sebastian Reidel's Rakudo * logo][rakudo].
